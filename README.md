Sono-Luminiscence
==================

Make you Linux box dance to the beats of your music.

This hack has been made by tweaking the PulseAudio Volume Control to interact with the brightness file sitting in ``/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0``.

To make this work, clone this repository and then, enter the cloned directory and run the following commands.
``sudo su`` - For logging in as root.
``./configure`` - For configuring the source tree.
``make`` - For compilation
``make install`` - For installation

This should work. If it doesnt, feel free to contact me at krngrvr09@gmail.com
